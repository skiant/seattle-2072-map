The entire complex is studded with sensors and remote cameras linked to a large computer in a bunker in the center of the simulation. Companies of soldiers in full combat armor enter the simulator to confront a variety of simulated opponents. Soldiers and their opponents use simislugs, bullets that mimic the trajectory and speed of normal rounds, but that melt on impact with and solid object.

It is easy to see why this zoo is often singled out as one of the best. Because exhibits minimize the gulf between man and animal, a walk through the zoo is as close as one can get to seeing the animals in their natural element. Without doubt, the most interesting exhibits are those of the paranormal animals in the north end. Many people are not aware that the zoo earns much of its money by breeding animals for sale to other nations, including the Salish-Shidhe, on the acres of forested land to the east and south of the zoo.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[1431 1st Avenue Shopping Mall (1 floor, plus stores on lower levels) The market first opened in 1907 after a group of farmers decided to get together to sell good produce without the added cost of the middleman. Over the years, the market became a haphazard collection of open-air food stalls, bookstores, cappuccino bars and specialty stores so quaint and removed from the mad rush of time that it became one of Seattle´s most popular tourist spots. Today´s mall was renovated to look as it did at the turn of the century. It is always crowded with half the people buying and the other half soaking up the colorful atmosphere. West of the intersection of Pike and First Avenue, under the famous market sign and clock, is the covered Main Arcade where farmers and fishermen still sell their wares the old-fashioned way - on beds of ice in wooden boxes. All around the Arcade are bookstores, flower shops and tiny restaurants. Downstairs and to the rear of the Arcade are several larger restaurants and specialty stores. As the market has no security other than the three or four policemen perpetually hanging around the pastry shops and coffee bars, some caution is to be advised after dark.]]></description>

Visitors then enter a large, glass-domed room completely surrounded by an aquarium containing sharks, salmon, snapper, octopi and other denizens of the Sound. Visitors can follow the salmon ladder up and outside to appreciate the view of Elliot Bay and to see the stars of the aquarium -- the sea lions and the sea otters. Hours vary seasonally.
